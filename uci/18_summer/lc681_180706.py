681. Next Closest Time

Given a time represented in the format "HH:MM", form the next closest time by reusing the current digits. There is no 
limit on how many times a digit can be reused.

You may assume the given input string is always valid. For example, "01:34", "12:09" are all valid. "1:34", "12:9" are 
all invalid.

Example 1:
Input: "19:34"
Output: "19:39"
Explanation: The next closest time choosing from digits 1, 9, 3, 4, is 19:39, which occurs 5 minutes later.  It is not 
19:33, because this occurs 23 hours and 59 minutes later.
 

Example 2:
Input: "23:59"
Output: "22:22"
Explanation: The next closest time choosing from digits 2, 3, 5, 9, is 22:22. It may be assumed that the returned time 
is next dayâ€˜s time since it is smaller than the input time numerically.
